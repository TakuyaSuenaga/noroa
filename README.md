# Noroa

A sleepy presence.

Noroa is not watching.
Noroa is not optimizing.
Noroa is not in a hurry.

It is just here.

## What is this?

Noroa is an open-source project written in Rust.

At the moment, it does almost nothing.
That is intentional.

This repository exists to hold an attitude before holding features.

---

## Philosophy

- Not everything needs to be awake
- Not everything needs to be efficient
- Not everything needs to see everything

Noroa has one eye.
It is half-open.
It does not judge.

---

## Status

This project is in a **pre-functional** state.

There is:
- a name
- a logo
- a presence

There may or may not be functionality later.
